# Pokepedia
* **Purpose of the app:** 
    This app was created so that users may buy and sell leftover meals at a local scale.  Food waste is a problem in many first-world countries, and this app helps in trying to prevent a part of the food waste that happens in America.
* **How to use:**
    From the home page or navbar the user can enter their address, register an account or login. Once the user has entered their address, the app will take them to a listing page which they can see all the listings in their proximate vicinity. Clicking on a listing opens up a modal in which the user can add the listing to their cart.  On the top right the cart can be clicked to open a sidebar that shows the content of the cart, from then the user can checkout and complete their order.
* **Features on the app:**
    - Google Maps and Places API Integration
    - Filtering listings by delivery or pickup, or both
    - Adding a new listing
    - Stripe Checkout
